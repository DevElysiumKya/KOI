        The two dominant European orgs solidify a new venture to transcend local markets and build a global legacy in competitive esports and entertainment
        </p><p>
        Spain and New York – (October 6, 2022) – Rogue, current LEC champions, and parent company Infinite Reality, are joining forces with KOI, the electrifying Spanish esports organization founded by former LVP caster and Twitch star Ibai Llanos and professional footballer and founder of sports media investment firm Kosmos Gerard Piqué. The formidable strategic alliance kicks off in early 2023 and will see the organizations combining their strengths to dominate esports in Europe.

        Ibai Llanos, the social media celebrity and Twitch luminary who operates the fourth most followed channel in the world, will serve as a featured ambassador of the partnership across both KOI and Rogue, including KOI’s competitive teams in the much-anticipated pro Valorant league and LVP SuperLiga, as well as Rogue’s teams in Call of Duty, Rocket League, Rainbow Six, and their championship League of Legends roster- the number one LEC seed entering into next week’s Worlds competition.
